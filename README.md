# **Astronomical Dataset Analysis**
**Project Overview**\
This project involves the analysis of an astronomical dataset containing information about various stars. The goal is to explore the dataset, perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing, and create insightful visualizations to understand the properties and classifications of the stars.

**Dataset Description**\

The dataset consists of the following columns:

Temperature (K): The temperature of the star in Kelvin.\
Luminosity (L/Lo): The luminosity of the star compared to the Sun.\
Radius (R/Ro): The radius of the star compared to the Sun.\
Absolute Magnitude (Mv): The absolute magnitude of the star, a measure of its brightness as seen from 10 parsecs away.\
Star Type: The classification of the star (e.g., dwarf, giant, supergiant).\
Star Color: The color of the star as observed (e.g., white, blue, yellow).\
Spectral Class: The spectral classification of the star (e.g., O, B, A, F, G, K, M).

**Conclusion**\
This project provided a detailed analysis of an astronomical dataset, uncovering various relationships and patterns among the stars. The visualizations, particularly the HR diagrams, offered significant insights into the classification and properties of stars.

**Future Work**\
Advanced Modeling: Implementing machine learning models to predict star types or other properties based on the features.
Additional Datasets: Integrating more astronomical datasets to enhance the analysis and gain deeper insights.
